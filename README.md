# DiffSim-μGUIDE

This project is part of the [VIC-HACK 2024](https://github.com/Lewis-Kitchingman/VIC-HACK-2024.git) hackathon organised at Cardiff University and is co-lead by Bradley Karat and Maëliss Jallais.

The aim of this project is to integrate simulations from [DiffSimGEN](https://github.com/Bradley-Karat/DiffSimGen.git) into [μGUIDE](https://github.com/mjallais/uGUIDE.git).
